# Stochastic Variational Deep Kernel Learning (SVDKL) for Epistemic Uncertainty

This is a tutorial / personal research project on how to utilize SVDKL for detecting epistemic uncertainty in testing data. 
It is promising work, in no way is it completely polished, but I think there's a lot to be gained from learning about this tool!
I have already pretrained the model used in the notebook, and can be found publicly here on my google drive. Feel free to use this 
instead of training your own!
